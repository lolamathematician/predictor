Increase speed of getting data. Almost all run time is spent filtering results. Ideas to test faster method:
Get rid of readable times calculations
Use generator with list of keys to create filtered data dicts (will mean no readable times - could just use the date rather than using datetime to calculate datetime)
Use other language to do this - Save all attributes and filter down to comment_attributes_included.txt using c or java.
